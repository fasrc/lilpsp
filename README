lilpsp -- a little psp website framework

INTRODUCTION
============

This is a little framework for creating simple, dynamic websites using psp 
(mod_python's python sever pages).  It covers basic logging, error catching, 
sessions/authentication, etc., and it also provides some wrappers for common 
functionality like sending email, executing shell code, etc.

To create a website, just stick this somewhere on the filesystem and point an 
apache config at it (see below for details).  To do anything real, you will 
surely want to change the options in lilpsp/config.py and the html blurbs in 
lilpsp/org.py, fill in index.psp, and add some other .psp pages.

The org.py module also defines some functions for getting information about 
users, authenticating users, etc. that may or may not be used, and may or may 
not require implementation, depending on your configuration.


ORIENTATION AND LAYOUT
======================

The package will sit somewhere on the filesystem, /PATH/TO/MYSITE/, and 
therefore look like this:

	/PATH/TO/MYSITE/lilpsp/*.py
	/PATH/TO/MYSITE/*.psp
	/PATH/TO/MYSITE/*.html

By default, the site will log to /var/log/httpd/MYSITE.log.

From the lilpsp python package, it's expected you will want to modify:
	
	lilpsp/config.py
	lilpsp/org.py

(see below for details) plus add any other python modules providing specific 
site functionality.  You will also want to modify:

	header.html
	footer.html

as these are designed to be included at the top and bottom of every .psp page.  
The file login.psp is not intended to be modified; its customizable content is 
contructed from the above files.

The rest of your site is up to you.  The file:

	index.psp

provides the basic example for a dynamic html page.  Content between the 
`#--- BEGIN TEMPLATE CODE...` and `#--- ...END TEMPLATE CODE` should not need 
to be modified.  There are also:
	
	lilpsp/exampleHandler.py
	exampleHandlerFailure.psp

which provide an example of dynamic creation of non-html content, in this case 
a png image.  Delete these files if you're not using them.


CONFIGURATION
=============

Basics
------

There are two main files designed for tweaking the site.  The first is:

	core.py

This defines basic parameters like where to log, and what type of 
authentication, if any, to require.  See the comments in the file for details 
on each option.

The other is:
	
	org.py

This has the html blurbs used in standard pages (error pages, login page (if 
used), etc.); tweak these as desired.  There are also methods used for getting 
user information about users, authenticating users, etc.  A couple of these are 
even just defined for convenience and are never called by any of the provided 
content.  However, the function org.authenticateUser() must be implemented if 
using AUTH_TYPE='FORM' (see below).

Authentication
--------------

Included in config.py is a parameter AUTH_TYPE for choosing what type of 
authentication to require in order to use the website.  There is currently 
support for three modes of authentication -- none (NONE), relying on apache to 
do it (HTTP), and internal implementation (FORM).  All dynamic content must 
call core.sessionCheck() in order for these choices to be respected.

For NONE, core.sessionCheck() does nothing.

For HTTP, core.sessionCheck() just makes sure req.user is set.

For FORM, core.sessionCheck() redirects any non-authenticated request to 
login.psp, which presents a form for authentication.  That page calls 
org.authenticateUser(), which you must implement.  Upon successful 
authentication, the user will be redirected back to the original page 
requested.  PSP's cookie-based session objects 
(http://www.modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/pyapi-sess.html) are used to 
persist the authenticated session across http requests.  The login.psp page 
serves as a logout page, too (visiting this page while logged in will 
automatically log the user out).


APACHE CONFIGURATION
====================

Apache will need something like the following:

	Alias /MYSITE "/PATH/TO/MYSITE/"
	<Location "/MYSITE">
			AddHandler mod_python .psp
			PythonHandler mod_python.psp
			PythonDebug Off
			PythonPath "['/PATH/TO/MYSITE']+sys.path"

			##cookie path -- use the first case for mod_python >= 3.3, the second for earlier
        	#PythonOption mod_python.session.application_path /MYSITE
			PythonOption ApplicationPath /MYSITE
			
			DirectoryIndex index.psp
	</Location>

Set PythonDebug On if you wish tracebacks to be delivered to the browser when 
uncaught exceptions occur (almost all exceptions are caught, but there is 
always the possiblity).

To use exampleHandler.py and exampleHandlerFailure.py, as an example of 
implementing direct handlers for non-html content, apache will need something 
like the following:

	<Location "/MYSITE/example.png">
			SetHandler mod_python
			PythonHandler lilpsp.exampleHandler::dynamicPNG
	</Location>

When setting up multiple sites using lilpsp, I've had sites get confused about 
which .py files its using -- i.e. one site would be using the other's, as if 
all apache Locations got all PythonPath modifications.  I don't understand 
this, therefore in practice I rename lilpsp to something unique for each site 
on the same server.


CODE CONSIDERATIONS
===================

Error Handling
--------------

The basic design is that the .py files raise Exceptions with informative error 
messages (and do not log these), and the .psp pages decide what to do with them 
(log, serve up an error page, bail out, etc.).  The value of DEBUG in config.py 
controls how much detail is in the exception and log messages, and mod_python's 
normal PythonDebug directive controls how much is detail is delivered to the 
browser (in the case of uncaught exceptions).  You'll notice that the .psp 
pages are basically wrapped in one big try/except in order to avoid uncaught 
exceptions.  Each .psp page also defines a BreakOut Exception used to quit page 
generation early, usually after an error message has been written 
(using apache.SERVER_RETURN would arguably be better).

Directly handlers, e.g. exampleHandler.py, since, like .psp pages, they are 
responsible for entire response content should not raise exceptions, should 
likewise catch and handle all exceptions.

Miscellaneous
-------------

It is assumed that all .psp pages are in the same directory and referred to by 
the same base url, and all dynamical non-html content is similarly represented 
by a filename off that base url.  For example, the the login.psp redirection 
assumes it's a sibling file with whatever calls it.
